# Notes on Exercises 30-39

### ex35
- TESTHEAD's blog has a [map of the game](http://www.mkltesthead.com/2011/12/exercise-35-branches-and-functions.html) (study drill 1)
- **=~** match operator used for the first time in LRtHW 

### ex37

**Learning [these symbols](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex37.html)** is ongoing but I decided to make a learning aid - similar to flashcards. Typing 'test' generates a random word that the user then has to explain / give an example for. There are no answers, just a prompt, but could be extended after hashes are covered later in LRtHW. You can add to the list of keywords to be tested in the program (as well as saving and loading lists).
- Used [Swanand's Stack Overflow Answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3308393/how-to-store-a-ruby-array-into-a-file) for help retrieving saved lists from a file.

The rest of this exercise is about reading more code and trying to understand it. Examples [here](http://learnruby.com/code.html) and [here](http://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/ruby.html)
